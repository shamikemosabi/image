@todo
- auto swap when loot full

- currently, command config:, swap: only works IF screen is currently in Village.
  If I call this command and it's mid battle, it will get stuck at return to home screen from battle.
  (because method is call from within read=2)


@bug

- config.xml sometimes gets cut off. Not sure if it's FTP problem, or writing from docuemnt to config file problem.

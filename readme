@todo

- dump info from hash, arrays into a file maybe, so I can view it. Stats like when accounts were last swapped, etc...

- Auto BUILD new buildings


- currently, command config:, swap: only works IF screen is currently in Village.
  If I call this command and it's mid battle, it will get stuck at return to home screen from battle.
  (because method is call from within read=2)

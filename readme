@todo
- if neither gold/elixir full, lets to random and pick one instead of always gold.
	Maybe a way to calculate which is more gold or elixlir, something to think about.
	
- A service that check for stuck pages:
  Bluestack search for battle stuck - maybe read the return home image, compare it multiple times (+ 20 secs), if image always the saem then means we are stuck
  try new app page 

- Auto BUILD new buildings


- currently, command config:, swap: only works IF screen is currently in Village.
  If I call this command and it's mid battle, it will get stuck at return to home screen from battle.
  (because method is call from within read=2)
